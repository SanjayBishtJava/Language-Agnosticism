# Language Agnostic

## How to become langaguge agnostic?
 -  Step1 - Code in differnt programming languages.
 -  Step2 - Understand and implement differnt programming paradigms. 
 -  Step3 - Implement different algorithms in various programming languages.
 -  Step4 - Implement webapps, webapp internals in different programming languages.
 -  Step5 - Implement Best practices in different programming languages.



### Approach
- This repo contains branches for every language. 
Every branch will have folders With implementations like
1. Language Basics
2. Algorithms.
3. Programming paradigms
4. Webapp Internals
4. Blockchain Internals

Problem statements and their solutions will be defined in separate git repositories like
1. Language Basics- online compilers - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm
2. Algorithms. (https://github.com/mankenavenkatesh/algorithms)
3. Programming Paradigms (https://github.com/mankenavenkatesh/ProgrammingParadigms)
4. Webapp-internals (https://github.com/mankenavenkatesh/webapp-internals)
5. Blockchain Internals (https://github.com/mankenavenkatesh/blockchain-internals)

and refered to above folders.
