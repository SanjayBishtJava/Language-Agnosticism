# Language Agnostic

## What does language agnosticsm mean?
Language Agnosticism means choosing a language that best fits a particular task based on factors like ecosystem, developer skill-sets, performance etc. If you are a language agnostic aspirant, you need to transcend the boundary of a specific set of language. 

## Why should you be language agnostic?
1. You become a complete software engineer rather than simply being a Java developer or C++ developer.
2. Helps figure out how to use certain language features effectively
3. Gives rise to nimble thinking.When you know various languages, you tend to get the knack for finding quick solutions to future problems. The reason for this is well justified. Since you can think about your problem in several frameworks, chances are high for you to find a cleaner and effective solution to your problem.
4. A language agnostic software developer is a happy software developer

## How to become langaguge agnostic?
 -  Step1 - Code in differnt programming languages.
 -  Step2 - Understand and implement differnt programming paradigms. 
 -  Step3 - Implement different algorithms in various programming languages.
 -  Step4 - Implement webapps, webapp internals in different programming languages.
 -  Step5 - Implement Best practices in different programming languages.
### Approach
- This repo contains branches for every language. 
Every branch will have folders With implementations like
1. Language Basics
2. Algorithms.
3. Programming paradigms
4. Webapp Internals
4. Blockchain Internals

Problem statements and their solutions will be defined in separate git repositories like
1. Language Basics- online compilers - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm
2. Algorithms. (https://github.com/mankenavenkatesh/algorithms)
3. Programming Paradigms (https://github.com/mankenavenkatesh/ProgrammingParadigms)
4. Webapp-internals (https://github.com/mankenavenkatesh/webapp-internals)
5. Blockchain Internals (https://github.com/mankenavenkatesh/blockchain-internals)

and refered to above folders.
